  abstract = {Robust stability and control for systems that combine continuous-time
	and discrete-time dynamics. This article is a tutorial on modeling
	the dynamics of hybrid systems, on the elements of stability theory
	for hybrid systems, and on the basics of hybrid control. The presentation
	and selection of material is oriented toward the analysis of asymptotic
	stability in hybrid systems and the design of stabilizing hybrid
	controllers. Our emphasis on the robustness of asymptotic stability
	to data perturbation, external disturbances, and measurement error
	distinguishes the approach taken here from other approaches to hybrid
	systems. While we make some connections to alternative approaches,
	this article does not aspire to be a survey of the hybrid system
	literature, which is vast and multifaceted.},

  volume = {46},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes the dynamical properties of a class of hybrid
	systems simulators. A hybrid system is a dynamical system with a
	state that can both flow and jump. Its simulator attempts to generate
	its solutions approximately. The paper presents mild regularity conditions
	on the hybrid system and its simulator to guarantee that simulated
	solutions are close to actual solutions on compact (hybrid) time
	intervals, and that asymptotically stable compact sets are preserved,
	in a semiglobal practical sense, under simulation. In fact, it is
	established that asymptotically stable compact sets are continuous
	in the integration step size parameter of the simulator; that is,
	as the step size of the simulator converges to zero, the asymptotically
	stable set observed in simulations approaches the asymptotically
	stable compact set of the true hybrid system. Examples are used to
	illustrate concepts and results.},
